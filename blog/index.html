    <h2>Kicking off ROSSConf Berlin, come improve Ruby Open Source with us</h2>
    <p>Something that started out as an idea at <a href="http://2015.arrrrcamp.be/">ArrrrCamp</a> to make getting involved in open source more approachable is soon going to take place - again. ROSSConf Vienna exceeded our expectations and feedback like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ROSSConf was brilliant. 28 PRs from 9 different people, including several bug fixes and lots of great improvements to documentation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from <a href="https://twitter.com/kytrinyx">Katrina Owen</a> was enough of a push for us to immediately start to get the pieces together for the next event.</p>

<p>We are now knee-deep in preparations and we couldn't be happier with the support we received from second-time-sponsors <a href="https://codeship.com">Codeship</a> and <a href="http://www.wooga.com/">Wooga</a>, who will be hosting us. With Berlin's TV tower in sight, we think it's going to be a great location!</p>

<h3 id="hacking-on-bundler-docker-or-ruby-itself">Hacking on Bundler, Docker or… Ruby itself?</h3>

<p>Without further ado, let us introduce you to our amazingly excited and awesome speakers. Since the "R" in ROSSConf stands for "Ruby" it is a great pleasure to have one of the core contributors to Ruby and mad scientist at night, <a href="https://twitter.com/_zzak">Zachary Scott</a>. With your help we are confident Ruby can become even better!</p>

<p>After installing Ruby, what is the next thing you need? Right, Bundler! <a href="https://twitter.com/indirect">André Arko</a> has been helping you to bundle your dependencies for some time now. And there are always things to improve, fix and document. Let him show you what your next or maybe first contribution to a major open source project could look like.</p>

<p>If you are a fan of databases as much as you are a fan of Ruby, then Piotr Solnica (aka. 'the other Piotr S.') has got you covered. He already announced the release of the next ROM version to be at ROSSConf. There should be plenty of last minute things to do. Go, Test, Fix, Release!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rhein_wein">Laura Frank</a>, who joined us in Vienna as an attendee, brings not only one, not two, but eight (!) projects to Berlin. Some of which are in Go as well as in Ruby, and all put together are Panamax. On top of Docker it makes deploying complex application stacks a matter of a click!</p>

<p>Last but not least <a href="https://speakerinnen.org/">The Speakerinnen List</a> aims to increase the visibility and participation of women at conferences, panels and talk shows. The project is made and maintained by women of a RailsGirls study group called the rubymonsters. And… by you?</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What's next?</h3>

<p>We are still working out the deets, but if you are looking forward to ROSSConf Berlin as much as we are, then behold! <a href="http://www.rossconf.io/event/berlin.html#tickets">You can register now and reserve a seat!</a> To stay up to date, scroll and sign up for the mailing list if you haven't already!</p>

<p>Oh and one more thing! We are still looking for great partners to help us pull this off. If you and/or your company are interested in supporting us financially we'd love to hear from you. Please shoot us an email at hello@rossconf.io</p>
